# MachineLearning
This project provides models based on mobile development's design to predict and recommend options for reducing carbon emissions in two key domains: Meals and Transportation. The system uses machine learning to calculate and suggest alternatives with lower carbon footprints, helping users make more sustainable choices.

## Features
**1. Meals Model**
* Predict Carbon Emissions: Estimates the carbon emissions (kg CO2eq) for different meal categories.
* Recommend Lower-Carbon Meals: Suggests alternative meal categories with lower carbon emissions than the selected category.

**2. Transport Model**
* Predict Carbon Emissions: Calculates the carbon emissions for a given transport category and distance.
* Recommend Lower-Emission Transport Options: Suggests transport options that emit less CO2 for the same distance.

## Installation
* Python 3.7+
* Tensorflow
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
